              <h3>How do I book a carpool ride?</h3>
              <p>
                You can book a carpool ride on our mobile app, or on
                blablacar.com. Simply search for your destination, choose the
                date you want to travel and pick the carpool that suits you
                best! Some rides can be booked instantly, while other rides
                require manual approval from the driver. Either way, booking a
                carpool ride is fast, simple, and easy.

              <h3>How do I cancel my carpool ride?</h3>
              <p>
                If you have a change of plans, you can always cancel your
                carpool ride from the "Your rides" section of our app. The
                sooner you cancel, the better. That way, the driver has time to
                accept new passengers. The amount of your refund will depend on
                how far in advance you cancel. If you cancel more than 24 hours
                before departure, for example, you'll receive a full refund,
                excluding the service fee.

              <h3>How much does a carpool ride cost?</h3>
              <p>
                The costs of a carpool ride can vary greatly, and depend on
                factors like distance, time of departure, the demand for that
                ride and more. It is also up to the driver to decide how much to
                charge per seat, so it's hard to put an exact price tag on a
                ride. Check out some of our top carpool destinations to get an
                idea of price, or start searching for your next carpool ride on
                blablacar.com.

              <p>
                Offering a carpool ride on ShareMyRide is easy. To publish your
                ride, use our mobile app or ShareMyRide.com. Indicate your
                departure and arrival points, the date and time of your
                departure, how many passengers you can take and the price per
                seat. You'll also need to choose how you want to accept bookings
                (either automatically or manually), and you have the option of
                adding any important details you think your passengers should
                know about. Then tap "Publish ride" and you're done!

              <h3>What are the benefits of travelling by carpool?</h3>
              <p>
                There are multiple advantages to carpooling, over other means of
                transport. Travelling by carpool is usually more affordable,
                especially for longer distances. Carpooling is also more
                eco-friendly, as sharing a car means there will be fewer cars on
                the road, and therefore fewer emissions. Taking a carpool ride
                is also a safe way to travel in the current times. Because there
                are only a few people in a car, you have fewer points of contact
                and there's less risk than other travel options.
